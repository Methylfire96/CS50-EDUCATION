Energy (active songs): min = 0.296, max = 0.909 avg = 0.659
Valence (positivness): min = 0.07 , max = 0.931 , avg = 0.484
Danceability: min = 0.258 , max = 0.964 , avg = 0.716

the audio aura from 2018 is set up of average active songs, with a more sad background but with a high danceability.

def. better calculation would be, if there is a genre added.
plus people feel, act differently to certain music type or lyrics in songs .
same artist, different songs, which would represent a different mood set.
