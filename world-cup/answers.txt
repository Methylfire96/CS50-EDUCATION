Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
Belgium gets a higher chance to win over Brazil, the more simulations are running through.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
After aprox. 10000 simulations.
